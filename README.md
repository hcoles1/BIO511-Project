# BIO511-Project
This example dataset contains data from testing Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in a two choice Y-maze scented with either conspecific pheromones in one arm or the other arm for two different populations.
The first column contains the “FishID” which lists the fish for each experiment (integer). The second and third columns contain the numerical amount of time each fish spent in either “Arm 1” or “Arm 2” in the allotted time for the trial. Column 4 is the sum of the “total time spent in both arms” (numeric). Column five and six contain the “treatment in arm 1” and “treatment in arm 2” (categorical).
